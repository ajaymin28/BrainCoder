# 🧠 BrainCoder

**BrainCoder** is a research project focused on decoding visual stimuli from EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals.  
The goal is to **learn generalized features** from brain activity that can accurately predict image representations across different subjects, enabling cross-subject decoding.

This project explores how to align EEG signals with powerful visual-semantic embeddings like [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip).

## 📚 Project Overview

- **Problem:** EEG signals are noisy and highly subject-specific, making cross-subject generalization challenging.
- **Solution:** Train models that map EEG signals to the corresponding **CLIP image features** while minimizing subject-specific variance.
- **Key idea:**  
  - Learn **subject-invariant** EEG representations.
  - Align EEG encodings with **vision-language embeddings**.

## 🧠 Dataset

- EEG recordings collected while subjects viewed images.
- Each EEG signal is paired with the corresponding **CLIP image embedding**.
- Preprocessing steps: filtering, segmentation, normalization.

(*Dataset loading scripts are available in the `dataset/` folder.*)

## ✨ Features

- Flexible EEG encoder architectures.
- Subject-invariant training (domain adversarial techniques planned).
- Contrastive learning between EEG features and image embeddings.
- Modular and easily extensible codebase.

## 📈 TODOs
- [ ] Update readme.md
- [ ] Add domain adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization.
- [ ] Extend to zero-shot classification using CLIP text embeddings.
- [ ] Improve visualization of EEG feature space (e.g., t-SNE plots).
- [ ] Add pretrained model checkpoints.
